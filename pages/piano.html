    <h1>Piano Recordings</h1>
    <p>My piano that I play is a 7' 8" Petrof and it's absolutely BEAUTIFUL! I hope I can do it
        justice... I'm literally just recording with my Lenovo Thinkpad (running Arch btw) or on
        my smartphone. It sounds kinda dog but I can't afford a nice mic. I hope you can enjoy!
    </p>

    <h3>Chopin Op.9 No.2</h3>
    <p>(Recorded on my phone) I absolutely love this Chopin piece because it's just absolutely beautiful and Chopin makes the best nocturnes!</p>

    <h3>Chopin Op.64 Nr.2</h3>
    <p>This was recorded on my phone and I think I did pretty well! Hopefully I'll be able to 
        record this again on an actually nice mic sometime!

    <h3>Maple Leaf Rag - Scott Joplin</h3>
    <p>I've been working on this piece forever and the ending part still isn't great, but I'm getting there! Hopefully I'll be able to play
        through this whole piece without messing up one day!

    <h3>No Holly for Miss Quinn - Enya</h3>
    <p>Just a gorgeous piece that I love dearly since my mother used to play Enya for me all the time as a kid.</p>

    <h3>Shepherd Moons - Enya</h3>
    <p>Another wonderful Enya piece. If you want to get into piano playing, Enya has some great beginner pieces that are good after you
        know a bit about the piano and have been playing for maybe a couple months. (P.S. HANNAH WHY DID YOU HAVE TO SNEEZE SO LOUD)

    <h3>Hymn 335 - Brightly Beams our Father's Mercy</h3>
    <p>Recorded this on my phone and played on our Yamaha Clavinova electric piano. I played this in church while a bunch of the young men sung along! Fun times.

    <h3>Foundation Level 1 of Simply Music</h3>
    <p>These are all of the songs from Foundation 1 of Simply Music (simplymusic.com) and I thought it'd be fun
        to play through them all! Obviously very easy, but might as well drop it off onto here.
